# discord.js-reaction-verification-bot
Simple discord.js verification bot
This have been coded in a few minutes while eating crisps, so code may be kinda bad, when bot crashes or you just turn it off you have to create new verification message <br>
Feel free to edit the code and if you want you can pull request if you have done something useful :D <br>

<h2>How to use?</h2>
1. You have to create new node.js project with discord.js module installed. <br>
2. Go to config.json and set the config here. <br>
3. Just run run bot :D! <br>

<h2>NOTE | IMPORTANT</h2>
Remember to lock the verification channel so users cant send messages and use the command, because user doesnt need permissions to use it! :D
